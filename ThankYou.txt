A Huge thanks to GeekTrust, for the awesome guidance:

I know it may be unncesessary, but I wanted to thank Geektrust for giving me major guidelines.

- The code is still a bit messy but I tried my best to improve it as much as I could.
- Tried learning unit tests and tried implementing a bit. (Tried Mock tests but failed for now).
- Learned how to package my code better.
- Tried my best to avoid speghetti code this time around.
- And most importantly, I got to know what to learn next.

Thank you, this was an amazing experience.
